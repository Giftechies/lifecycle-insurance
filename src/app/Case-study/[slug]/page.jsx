    "During an annual insurance review with a husband and wife in their early 40s, the husband expressed interest in removing his wife's trauma cover to save on premiums. Given their age group and the increasing health risks that can arise in the 40s, I strongly advised against cancelling the cover. After discussing the long-term implications and the importance of financial protection, the couple decided to retain the policy.",
      "Just six months later, the wife was unexpectedly diagnosed with a tumor. Fortunately, her trauma cover was still in place, and a claim was successfully lodged—resulting in a $110,000 payout. This financial support allowed the family to focus entirely on her treatment and recovery without the added stress of financial strain."

    result:"The good news is that she made a full recovery, and the family is now even more appreciative of the importance of maintaining comprehensive insurance cover. This situation reinforces how critical it is to have the right protections in place—especially when they’re needed most.",
