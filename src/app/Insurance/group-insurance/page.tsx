                      What Is Group Insurance?

                      {" "}
                      Group Insurance, as the name suggests, is a type of
                      Insurance that is ideal for businesses. This provides
                      cover for a group of individuals, under a single policy.
                      It is suitable for businesses to offer meaningful benefits
                      to their team members such as life Insurance, income
                      protection, etc.{" "}

                    <p className=" mt-1 lg:mt-2 ">
                      {" "}
                      Since group Insurance is a combination of multiple
                      policies in one, it offers outstanding benefits with
                      reduced premiums.{" "}
