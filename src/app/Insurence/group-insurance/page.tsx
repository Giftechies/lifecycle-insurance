                What Is Group Insurance?
                    </h1>
                     <p className=" mt-1 lg:mt-4 ">    Group insurance, as the name suggests, is a type of insurance that is ideal for businesses. This provides cover for a group of individuals, under a single policy. It is suitable for businesses to offer meaningful benefits to their team members such as life insurance, income protection, etc.          </p>
                     <p className=" mt-1 lg:mt-2 ">    Since group insurance is a combination of multiple policies in one, it offers outstanding benefits with reduced premiums.         </p>
